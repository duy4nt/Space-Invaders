# Space Invaders
Why I chose to make a game you ask? cause I love programming and the best way to get better at programming is to make a game(and yes that's true, to some extent) and why this game? cause this was one of the first games I used to play.
Enough of background story, now lets get to the game plan. I am not making a direct copy of the original game. Its sort of different.
## Plans
The hero sprite will spawn in the middle bottom of the screen; and yes I chose the retro themed resolution cause why not.
The enemy sprite will spawn at the top and move towards the hero sprite in a linear path, which would pass through the position of the hero sprite at the time of dying of the previous sprite.
There will be 3 levels of difficulty. In the easy difficutlty there will be one sprite, on the medium difficulty, there will be 3 sprite on the screen, at one time, and on the hard level, there will be random number of enemy sprites on the screen at a time, i havent thought about a maximum number of sprites.
The enemy sprite can come from any side, but thats a topic for some other time, for not the enemy sprite will spawn from the top poisiotn and random x poisiton.
